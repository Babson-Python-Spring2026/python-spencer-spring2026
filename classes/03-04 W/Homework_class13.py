Homework: Reading Code with State / Transitions / Invariants (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This program brute-forces tic-tac-toe WITHOUT recursion.

What it actually counts:
- It explores all possible games where X starts and players alternate.
- The search STOPS as soon as someone wins (a terminal state).
- It also records full boards that end in a tie.
- It tracks UNIQUE *terminal* boards “up to symmetry” (rotations + reflections),
  meaning rotated/flipped versions are treated as the same terminal board.

YOUR TASKS:

RULE:  Do not change any executable code (no reformatting logic, no renaming variables, no moving lines). 
       Only add/replace comments and docstrings.
       
1) Define STATE for this program.
   - What variables change as the program runs?
2) Explain where TRANSITIONS happen.
   - Where does the state change? (where in the code, which functions)
3) Identify 4 INVARIANTS.
   - What properties remain true as the program runs (and what checks enforce them).
   - For instance: has_winner() is a check; the invariant is “we do not continue exploring after a win.”
4) For every function that says ''' TODO ''', replace that docstring with a real explanation
   of what the function does (1-4 sentences).
5) Add inline comments anywhere you see "# TODO" explaining what that code block is doing.
6) DO NOT USE AI. Write 5-8 sentences explaining one non-obvious part (choose one):  
   (a) symmetry logic (what makes a board unique), 
   (b) why we undo moves, 
   (c) why standard_form() produces uniqueness
7) The output from the program is two print statements:
       127872
       138 81792 46080 91 44 3

    explain what each number represents.
