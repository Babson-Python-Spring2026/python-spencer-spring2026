    "\n",
    "**My answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `encrypt_map` needs to be a bijection because every input letter has to map to exactly one output letter, and every output letter has to come from exactly one input. If two letters mapped to the same output (like A->D and B->D), youd have no way to know if D in the ciphertext was originally A or B. One-to-one means unique outputs, onto means all 26 letters get used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reversing the pairs works because if encrypt says A->D, then decrypt needs to say D->A. By swapping key and value for every pair, we get exactly that. The encrypt map goes forward through the shift, the decrypt map goes backward. Since encrypt is a bijection, every value becomes a unique key in decrypt - no collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The alphabet only has 26 letters, so shifting by 26 is the same as shifting by 0 (you go all the way around and end up where you started). Shift 29 = 26 + 3, so you go around once then shift 3 more. The modulo operation strips out the full rotations and keeps just the meaningful part. Its like how 3pm and 15:00 are the same time on a 12 hour clock."

    "- Part 1B: Using `dist = abs(mid - row)` to automatically handle both halves. The distance shrinks then grows, which drives all the other calculations.\n",
    "- Part 2: The simple rule that if a character is a letter, increment letters. The transition is just \"scan left to right, update counters.\"\n",
    "- Part 3: Building the shifted alphabet by slicing `alphabet[shift_norm:] + alphabet[:shift_norm]`. This rotation is the core of the whole cipher.\n",

    "**3. Invariants that helped debug:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1A/1B: The outline invariant - every row should have exactly 1 or 2 stars. When I first ran it I was getting 3 stars on some rows because I messed up the inner_spaces formula. Easy to spot visually.\n",
    "- Part 2: The \"counts never decrease\" invariant. If I saw letters going down somehow, Id know something was wrong with my loop.\n",
    "- Part 3: The length invariant - output should be same length as input. If \"HELLO\" (5 chars) became \"PMTT\" (4 chars), something got dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Where a small bug would violate an invariant:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 3, if I forgot the `else` clause that handles non-letters, spaces would just disappear. \"HELLO WORLD\" would become \"PMTTWZGWO\" instead of \"PMTTW WTZWO\". The length invariant would catch this immediately - input has 11 characters but output would only have 10. Actually wait, I think I might have the encrypted version wrong there but the point stands - missing characters means broken invariant."
